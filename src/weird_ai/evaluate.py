"""
Evaluation helpers for Weird AI parody outputs.

Lesson 10 connects the verifier idea from reasoning-model evaluation to the
Weird AI project. Instead of checking whether a math answer is symbolically
correct, these functions check measurable features of generated parody lyrics:

- Can we extract the final parody from a longer model response?
- Can we normalize the lyrics into clean lines?
- Do adjacent lines rhyme?
- Are the line count and syllable counts reasonably consistent?

These scores are not a complete measure of creativity or humor. They are simple,
deterministic checks that make automated evaluation possible.
