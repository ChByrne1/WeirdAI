"""
Reasoning prompt helpers for Weird AI.

This module introduces the first lightweight reasoning-related utilities for
Weird AI. These functions do not train a reasoning model yet. Instead, they
help students explore how prompt structure can encourage a model to produce
intermediate reasoning steps before generating a final answer.

Lesson 8 connects the Weird AI parody assistant to the reasoning model portion
of the course by focusing on inference-time reasoning prompts.

def build_reasoning_prompt(user_prompt):
    """
    Convert a normal user prompt into a general reasoning prompt.

    The returned prompt should encourage the model to think through the task
    before giving its final answer.

    Args:
        user_prompt: The original user request as a string.

    Returns:
        A formatted prompt string that includes the original task and asks for
        step-by-step reasoning.

    # 4. Include a clear "Final Answer:" section.

def build_parody_reasoning_prompt(topic):
    """
    Build a reasoning prompt specifically for parody lyric generation.

    This prompt should guide Weird AI through a simple creative planning process
    before asking it to write the final parody lyrics.

        topic: The parody topic or user request as a string.

        A formatted prompt string with step-by-step parody planning sections.

    explicitly provided in the prompt. It should not use outside knowledge.

    Build a prompt for open-world reasoning.

    Open-world reasoning allows the model to consider both the provided premises
    and relevant background knowledge. This can reveal contradictions between
    the prompt and the model's background knowledge.
