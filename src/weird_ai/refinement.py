"""
Self-refinement utilities for Weird AI.

This module connects Chapter 5 of Build a Reasoning Model from Scratch to the
Weird AI project.

Chapter 4 added best-of-N generation:

    generate several candidates -> evaluate each -> select the best

Chapter 5 adds self-refinement:

    generate one candidate -> evaluate -> ask for a revision -> evaluate again
    -> keep the better version -> repeat

The goal is to improve output quality during inference without retraining the model.
